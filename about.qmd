I am actively working at [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) towards the long-term goal of merging the physical and digital worlds for greater by democratizing computer vision for every industry.

I believe that AGI is going to be a collection of smaller neural networks specialized towards a particular type of task or modality controlled by a large foundation model for cognition rather than a single insanely large foundation model for everything. My motivation is to build the [visual cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex) of this AGI system and bless our AI companions with a sense of sight.
