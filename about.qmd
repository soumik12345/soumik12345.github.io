# About Me

I am generally interested in the field of computer vision, particularly in foundation models for computer vision, generative models for images, implicit representation and representation learning.

I work on developing tools for Machine Learning parctioners at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site). My day-to-day tasks include

* developing and maintaining integrations with open-source libraries such as keras, ultralytics, super-gradients, kaolin-wisp, etc.
* prototyping experimental tools in the Weights & Biases ecosystem as part of [wandb-addons](https://github.com/soumik12345/wandb-addons).
* writing exciting and beautiful blog posts using [W&B Reports](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/reports).
