I work on developing tools for Machine Learning parctioners and LLMOps at [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site).

I am generally interested in the field of computer vision, particularly in foundation models for computer vision, computer graphics, generative models
for images, implicit representation and representation learning.

Besides my work, I'm an amateur musician (trained in violin, guitar, and Indian classical vocal) and a veteran of the soulsbourne genre of video games.

## My day-to-day Work

* developing and maintaining integrations with open-source libraries such as [keras](keras.io), [ðŸ¤— diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/index), [MONAI](https://monai.io/), etc.
* developing and maintaining [Weave](wandb.me/weave) integrations with open-source LLMOps libraries such as [DSPy](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app/), and GenAI vendors like [Groq](https://groq.com/).
* prototyping experimental tools in the [Weights & Biases](wandb.ai/site) and [Weave](wandb.me/weave) ecosystem.
* writing exciting and beautiful blog posts on machine learning using [W&B Reports](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/reports).
* talk about my work at different seminars, webinars, and events.

I'm fairly active in terms of open-source contributions. Besides [wandb](https://github.com/wandb/wandb) and [Weave](https://github.com/wandb/weave), I have contributed to
[Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), [KerasCV](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv), and
[Keras Examples](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io). Thanks to my job, I get to contribute to a lot of other open-source repositories
including [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics), [Super-Gradients](https://github.com/Deci-AI/super-gradients),
[Kaolin-Wisp](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin-wisp), [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric),
and many more. I have also developed and am maintaining the integrations of Weights & Biases with many of these repositories.
I am also actively working on [wandb-addons](https://github.com/soumik12345/wandb-addons) which hosts a set of experimental utilities
and integrations for Weights & Biases.
